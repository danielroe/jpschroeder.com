I'm a full stack developer based in [Charlottesville, VA](https://www.virginia.org/places-to-visit/regions/central-virginia/charlottesville/) and working at [FormKit](https://formkit.com). I’ve been writing code for about <year-count></year-count> so I’ve developed some pretty strong opinions about web development which I [tweet about](https://twitter.com/intent/user?screen_name=jpschroeder). I’ve also created a number of open source projects and enjoy speaking at conferences a few times a year.

If you ever find yourself in the same location as me and want to talk shop, just
