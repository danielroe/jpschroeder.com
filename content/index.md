## ðŸ‘‹ Hi there,

I'm Justin, a full stack developer based in [Charlottesville, VA](https://www.virginia.org/places-to-visit/regions/central-virginia/charlottesville/) and working at [FormKit](https://formkit.com). Iâ€™ve been writing code for ~<year-count></year-count> resulting in some strong opinions about development, especially web tech, which I often share on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/intent/user?screen_name=jpschroeder). When Iâ€™m not spending time with my wife or three little boys youâ€™ll find me creating and maintaining open&nbsp;source.

I keep my [DMs open on twitter](https://twitter.com/messages/compose?recipient_id=12008842) so feel free to contact me&nbsp;there.

## Open source

Creating open source projects is one of my passions. Here are some that Iâ€™ve&nbsp;created.

## Articles

I generally post long form thoughts, opinions, and announcements as articles on [dev.to](https://dev.to/dashboard). Here are a&nbsp;few.

## Speaking

I try to keep a running list of previous talks, meetups, and podcasts appearances&nbsp;here.
